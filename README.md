# Reader

![read!](http://irishrantings.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/pile-of-books2.jpg?raw=true)

You can read stuff like this

```bash
./reader < sometext.txt
```
    
If you have `pbpaste` the command below is easiest when copying from other sources.

```bash
pbpaste | reader
```

## Color theme

Reader, as it is currently configured, is best used with the [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme.
